# Learn ECMAScript - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Learn ECMAScript - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learn-ecmascript-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788620062), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
JavaScript is an integral part of web development and server-side programming. Understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript can not only help a person create interactive web applications but also help set up web servers, create mobile applications through frameworks such as React Native, and even create desktop applications using frameworks such as electronJS.

This book introduces the fresh and core concepts of JavaScript in the form of ECMAScript 2017 (ES8), which includes everything you'll need to get started with JavaScript and have a basic-to-advanced understanding so that you can implement everything mentioned in the first paragraph.

 
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
let myCounter = counter(); // returns a function (with count = 1)
myCounter(); // now returns 2
myCounter(); // now returns 3
```

Although it's not strictly required, it'll be great if you know a little about HTML/CSS and a little about how to create basic web pages using it.

You should be familiar with a modern browser (Chrome or Firefox is preferred) on a desktop/laptop.

To get the most out of this book, don't just read the book alone; keep other study sources open and implement as many of the demo and example codes as you can.
